        <p class="font1">In our lives, we all have searched for one thing or another. Sometimes, we searched for multiple things at once. We might have even felt what we were searching for were present for others but ever elusive for us. What are we doing wrong? How come others who weren’t even looking for that thing will get it, while we don’t?
            I read something recently about a woman who felt jealousy and resentment seeing her ex from many years ago have the very things that she longed for. She was very well put together, focused, and generally tried to live a good life. Her ex, however, when he was with her, was not someone who was ambitious or treated her nicely. Yet, many years later, he has a loving, supportive wife and kids who adore him.
            By many measures, life didn’t turn out fair. Maybe it was because he wasn’t actively seeking his now-lifestyle, he attracted someone who liked how he was uninhibited and possibly aloof. As life progressed, he happened to grow into someone who felt blessed to have the things he once took for granted.
            That reminds me of the two schools of thought: either we actively search for what we want, or we take a passive stance by letting what we want come to us by manifesting it.
            The internet is divided on this. On one hand, we can find many articles and anecdotes about pursuing our dreams and we are in control of our future. On the other, there are also just as many motivational speeches and mentors telling us the act of searching makes what we are looking for all the more elusive.
            After trying out both sides, I’ve come to the conclusion what’s best for me is to figure out what I want, search for it, and then detach from the outcome. Instead, what I need to do is immerse in the process by improving myself so I am ready for what I want when I attract it.
            The stories for July remind me of just that. The authors all have searched for something in their lives. It was pursuing the process that led them to their outcome. Even though the actual outcome may have been different than what they first pictured, it was nevertheless just as desirable. As they say, be grateful for the wishes that didn’t come true, to allow for those that are better suited to manifest.</p>
